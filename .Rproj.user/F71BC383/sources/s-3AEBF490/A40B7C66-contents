### Question 1: Parameter(s)

> Define the population parameter(s) of interest associated with the research objective.  Only define parameter(s) that are specifically associated with the research objective.  Include both the definition in the context of the problem as well as the symbol you will use to represent the parameter(s).  _Hint: look at your Model in Q3 and your Hypotheses in Q4._

### Question 2: Variables

> List all variables which you will record on each unit of observation (subject) in the sample.  You should clearly identify the role of each variable listed (e.g., response, predictor, factor, block, or extraneous variable...note, not all types of variables may be present in your question).  Be sure to specify the units of measurement, when applicable.

Delete this line and place your response here (hopefully, you get the idea)...


### Question 3: Model

> State an appropriate model for the data generating process.




### Question 4: Hypothesis

> If appropriate, state the hypotheses associated with the research objective using the parameters you defined above.  If the research objective does not involve testing hypotheses, clearly identify the parameter you will estimate and with what level of confidence this parameter will be estimated.




### Question 5: Data Collection

> In one or two paragraphs, describe your data collection procedure.  There should be enough detail of the process that an outside party could re-create your collection scheme.  As a part of your description, state the practices implemented during data collection which helped create a set of measurements that should be representative of the population (for example, the use of randomization).  




### Question 6: Limitations and Sources of Error

> A limitation to a study is a setting that was the same across all observations _and_ limits the population of interest in some respect.  Certainly, in order to complete your study in the allotted time, you will need to impose limitations on the scope of your study.  That is, if you were to conduct the study again with more time and resources, you might have done a few things differently.  A source of variability is something that differs from one observation to the next and contributes to why the responses differ across observations.  State one limitation of the study design _and_ describe why you believe it is a limitation.  Then, state one source of variability in your study.  Note: "sample size" is not a valid "limitation."




### Question 7: Graphic

> Construct _and_ describe a graphical summary of the data collected.




### Question 8: Conditions

> State any conditions/assumptions of the statistical inference technique you are planning to use.  Also, discuss how reasonable you feel each is.  If any plots are generated to do this, they should be included here.




### Question 9: Analysis

> Provide all relevant computer output here from the statistical analysis you used to address the research objective (e.g. p-values, confidence intervals, model fits, et. cetera).  If your analysis requires any conditions/assumptions that you found unreasonable, please be sure to describe those here.  




### Question 10: Conclusion

> Based on the results above, interpret your findings in context.  That is, what can be concluded about the research objective/question?
