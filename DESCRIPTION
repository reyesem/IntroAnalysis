Description: This package provides wrappers that give a single
    interface for working with linear models during an introductory
    statistics course.  These wrappers allow you to estimate the 
    parameters in a linear model or compare (nested) linear models
    (i.e., hypothesis testing). These wrappers provide a consistent 
    interface for performing these actions both under the classical
    conditions as well as when bootstrapping.  In addition, functions
    for performing the bootstrapping are provided.
